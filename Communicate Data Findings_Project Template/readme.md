## Summary of Findings

>This bike share system has greatly identified the need of the times and created a business that is profitable to both the end customers and the business. It is definitely a win-win solution:
By taking the user type into account in the proccess of observing the dataset, it revealed the diffrent patterns between the two types. 
Each type had a different trend and was noted by applying the same analysis applied to the entire dataset. We observed the subscribers tend to have more rides on the weekdays than the weekends. 
In addition, most of the trips are either at the first of the business day at 8AM and 5PM. The subscribers trips are shorter. 
On the other hand, the customers usually take their rides on the weekend more than other days and their tips mostly in the middle of the day. Finally, their trips are longer than the subscribers.
